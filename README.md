#Jets Application

This application allows for the creation and maintenance of an "Airfield" to store an array of Jets for a given organization

### Description
Through the creation of Jet objects, stored in an ArrayList this app allows a user to input a list of jets from a text file, or enter them manually. The app has a menu that enables the user to interact with their jets by calling a variety of type-specific commands and methods. The user can also remove a jet from the fleet through the same menu.

### Technologies Used
This app uses:
Do-while loops
Multiple objects with specializations
Interfaces to enable said specializations


### Lessons Learned
This was my first time working with abstract base classes and interfaces, so the entire project was a lesson learned. Keeping track of the proper array list, ensure that any changes made are returned to the "Airfield array" was a big consideration.
